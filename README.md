# pokemon-redux
A React project demonstrating state management with Redux

## TODO:
- Create slices
   - turns: player, opponent
   - stats: health, moves
- create some selector hooks (just returns useSelector(selector fn))
- Dispatches: reset, next move, etc
- (when dispatching, just have a sleeper fn that waits a little bit before calling the next update)
- keyframe animations: add/remove classes, etc
